Hi! To run this program, please download the file ```Chess.jar```. Then, open the Terminal and type in ```java -jar Downloads/Chess.jar``` to run the program. It uses input and output on the console, and it will display its top move, a board score, and time elapsed. I've only tested this on my computer, so I can't guarantee that it will work without bugs on other computers.
